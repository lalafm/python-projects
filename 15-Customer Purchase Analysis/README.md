# 15- Customer Purchase Analysis

Online shopping decisions rely on how consumers engage with online store content. You work for a new startup company that has just launched a new online shopping website. The marketing team asks you, a new data scientist, to review a dataset of online shoppers' purchasing intentions gathered over the last year. Specifically, the team wants you to generate some insights into customer browsing behaviors in November and December, the busiest months for shoppers. You have decided to identify two groups of customers: those with a low purchase rate and returning customers. After identifying these groups, you want to determine the probability that any of these customers will make a purchase in a new marketing campaign to help gauge potential success for next year's sales.

The Data:

You are given an online_shopping_session_data.csv that contains several columns about each shopping session. Each shopping session corresponded to a single user.

Column	                    Description
SessionID	                unique session ID
Administrative	            number of pages visited related to the customer account
Administrative_Duration	    total amount of time spent (in seconds) on administrative pages
Informational	            number of pages visited related to the website and the company
Informational_Duration	    total amount of time spent (in seconds) on informational pages
ProductRelated	            number of pages visited related to available products
ProductRelated_Duration	    total amount of time spent (in seconds) on product-related pages
BounceRates	                average bounce rate of pages visited by the customer
ExitRates	                average exit rate of pages visited by the customer
PageValues	                average page value of pages visited by the customer
SpecialDay	                closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day
Weekend	                    indicator whether the session is on a weekend
Month	                    month of the session date
CustomerType	            customer type
Purchase	                class label whether the customer make a purchase

Tasks:

The marketing team asked you to analyze the behavior of online customers during November and December, the busiest months for shoppers.

1. What are the purchase rates for online shopping sessions by customer type for November and December? Store the result in a dictionary called purchase_rates in the format below using the exact names for keys.
purchase_rates = {"Returning_Customer": 0.254, "New_Customer": 0.276}

2. What is the strongest correlation in total time spent among page types by returning customers in November and December? Store the result in a dictionary called top_correlation in the format below using the exact names for keys.
top_correlation = {"pair": (x_duration, y_duration), "correlation": 0.345}

3. A new campaign for the returning customers will boost the purchase rate by 15%. What is the likelihood of achieving at least 100 sales out of 500 online shopping sessions for the returning customers? Store the result in a variable called prob_at_least_100_sales. Optional: plot a binomial probability distribution chart to visualize your chances.
